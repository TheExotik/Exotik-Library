# **What is**
- It's a fully "customizable" library with many kind of features.

# **What do i mean "Customizable"??**
- This library offers to you (server creator) and you (plugin developer) a bunch of features, as:


- **Files creation, manipulation.**
**(Developers)** `You can easily create any folder and file with a simple single line, you can also manipulate this file as you desire.`


- **Items & Blocks creation.**

- **(Both)** `You can create any custom block and item using "ExotikLibrary/Creation/Items.yml" file.`
- **(Server Creator)** `You can create a inventory to block writing "Inventory Size: 54" inside your custom block, at "NamespacedKey" list.`
- **(Developer)** `You can customize yours blocks/items with simples line, for example: "BlockInventory.create(block,player,54,"Diamond Chest")"
this will create a custom inventory to the block you have informed, and add player as the Owner of the block, so no one can access (except players who have OP or have been added to whitelist by the owner using "/library access add <player>"`
